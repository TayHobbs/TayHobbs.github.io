I recently had a situation where I wanted to use a Bootstrap table style, but be able to expand the row to show additional information.
After having difficulty with trying to do this with a Bootstrap table directly, I decided to create my own table matching Bootstrap's style,
because tables were already being used in other places.
This turned out to be easier than I originally expected. Using Bootstrap's built in columns and some custom CSS, we can get the look fairly simply.
I also use a tiny bit of jQuery to get a slide toggle effect to show the additional information.
Overall it was a fun exercise and I was pleased with the way it turned out.
