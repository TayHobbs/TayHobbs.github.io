I am currently a full-time employee of IMT Computer Services in Des Moines, Iowa. My main focus there is building and maintaining [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) projects while using Agile practices and Pair Programming,
as well as continuous deployment and integration. I also have the opportunity to work with [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) extensively throughout my work day.
I am also a part-time student at [Colorado Technical University](http://www.coloradotech.edu/) working towards a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a focus on web development.

When I'm not at work, I enjoy being active in the open source community, working on personal programming projects using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/),
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) and its numerous frameworks (especially [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)).
I also enjoy spending my time reading books (programing related and otherwise), cooking and baking, and playing a video game or two.


If you want to contact me to talk about what I've been working on recently, what I've been reading or playing, exchange recipes, or anything else, send me an <a href='mailto:hobbstay@gmail.com'>email</a>.
