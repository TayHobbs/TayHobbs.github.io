I am currently an Engineering Manager, working on building awesome software. When I'm not at work, I enjoy being active in the open source community, working on personal programming projects using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/),
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) and its numerous frameworks (especially [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)).
I also enjoy spending my time reading books (programing related and otherwise), cooking and baking, and playing a video game or two.


If you want to contact me to talk about what I've been working on recently, what I've been reading or playing, exchange recipes, or anything else, send me an <a href='mailto:hobbstay@gmail.com'>email</a>.
