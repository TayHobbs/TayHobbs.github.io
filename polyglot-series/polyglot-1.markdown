Polyglotism is the ability to comprehend and speak many different languages. Typically refering to spoken languages, the term is often applied in the development world
to describe an individual who can develop in multiple different languages. I have always been interested in learning multiple languages, both programming and spoken. I
believe that learning new languages gives you more than just learning a new syntax or a different way to say the the same thing, but actually provides you with an entirely
new tool set to use to think and solve problems. Languages are more than just the words that make them up, they are entire cultures that contain their own ideas for similar
and different problems. I believe that this applies to programming languages just as much as human languages. In pursuit of furthering my learning and providing myself with
as many tools as I can, I am starting a series to learn as many langauges as possible.

I won't be able to master each of these languages, that would take far too long. Instead I'm going to try to get a taste of each language, developing the same small program
in each one. The goal with this project is to see the different ways that languages solve installation, dependency management, TDD, etc. I will be starting with Python,
one of my "native" languages that I use every day to flush out the program and to have a clear goal for the rest of the languages.
