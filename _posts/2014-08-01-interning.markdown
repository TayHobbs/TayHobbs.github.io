I recently got an Internship opportunity at a software development company and I've decided to keep a blog to show what I've learned, and as a personal reminder of where I started from...
Their language of choice for backend is Python with Django, and they use Ember.js as their Javasript framework.
I've done Python tutorials and I enjoy the language, but I'm not too familiar with it.
I've never used Ember at all, and I'm not a fan of Javascript at all, but I'm willing to learn.

To start out though they have me building static websites for customers using Jeykll, and Bootstrap for the CSS styling. I'm also learning to get familiar with Github, all of which I'm now using for this blog.
